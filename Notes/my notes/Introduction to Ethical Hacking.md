# What is hacking?
- Hacking is exploiting system *vulnerabilities* and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized access to a system.
- **Ethical hacking** is finding weak points or loopholes in a system and reporting them to organizations.
- **Hacker** : the person who do the hacking.

# Types of hackers based on Ethics
1. *black hat hacker* : this hackers are bad or evil doing hackers. e.g Anonymous hackers.
2. *white hat hacker* : this hackers are good doing hackers. e.g Ethical hacker.
3. *grey hat hacker* : this hackers are either good or bad depending on the situation.

# Types of hackers based on skills

1. *Newbie / Noob* : don't have any knowledge about hacking.
2. *Script kiddie* : unskilled individuals who use scripts or programs developed by others for malicious intent.
3. *Hacker* : Perfectly skilled with less experience.
4. *Elite / Pro hacker* : Perfectly skilled with much more experience.

# Elements of Information security

## CIA triad 
- *Confidentiality* : permitting authorized access ( who )
- *Integrity* : data is trustworthy and accurate ( not altered )
- *Availability* : system and data are available when users need to use them.

# Skills needed to be a hacker

- [x] Programming
- [x] Networking
- [x] Linux
- [ ] System admin

# Phases of Hacking 

1. *Reconnaissance* : gathering information passive or active
2. *Scanning* : checking everything on the system
3. *Gaining Access* : 
4. *Maintaining Access* : trying to not be detected, may be leaving a **backdoor** 
5. *Clearing Tracks or Logs* : clear you hack so that you are not traced.

# Penetration Testing

- *Penetration Testing* : is method of evaluating the security of a system or network by simulating an attack to 
                    * find vulnerability
                    * secure measures and 
                    * document and report your finding

# Types of Pen-testing

1. *Black Box Pentesing* : tester is provided very limited information. eg he can be provided with IP address or domain name.
2. *White Box Pentesting* : tester is provided with significant amount of information. eg can be provided with network diagrams, set of user credentials, configurations.
3. *Grey Box Pentestin* : it is hybrid of black box and white box pentesting.

# Terms to understand 

### Red Team 
- *Red team*  is a group that pretends to be an enemy, attempts a physical or digital intrusion against an organization at the direction of that organization, then reports back so that the organization can improve their defenses.
- Red teams work for the organization or are hired by the organization.

### Vulnerability Assessment 
- *Vulnerability assessment*  is a systematic review of security weaknesses in a system.
- It evaluates if the system is susceptible to any known vulnerabilities, assigns severity levels to those vulnerabilities, and recommends remediation or mitigation, if and whenever needed.

### Security Audit
- *Security audit*  is a systematic evaluation of a company's information systems, networks, and physical infrastructure.
- Audits are conducted by a team of security professionals who use various tools and techniques to assess the current state of an organization's security posture.

### Blue Team
- *Blue Team* are the group responsible for defending an enterprise's use of information systems by maintaining its security posture against a group of mock attackers ( i.e Red Team ).

# Ethics of Cyber Security

1. Respect the privacy of others
2. Think before you type 
3. With great power comes great responsibility

- We should always have **PERMISSION** when conducting ethical hacking.
