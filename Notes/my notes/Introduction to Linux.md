# What is Linux?

- *Linux* is a **kernel**. 

# What is kernel?

- *Kernel* : is a code/program that is used to meet software and hardware.
     * It also allocates some resources.
     * This pic shows what a kernel is [[Pasted image 20240413145517.png]] 

# History of Linux

- In *1969*  first version of UNIX was created and it wasn't 
                                            * cheap & 
                                            * open-source
- Then *LINUS TORVALDS* created **Linux kernel** and posted it online on github to make it **open-source**. 
- In *1983 Richard Stallman* announced the **GNU PROJECT** and cofounded the *Free Software Foundation* in 1985.
- GNU is a free software replacement to UNIX OS, but it was just a software but not full OS.
- Thus GNU + LINUX kernel will give you  **GNU/LINUX OS**. 
- The GNU Linux project was started to create a Unix-like OS with source code that could be :
        * copied
        * modified
        * redistributed

# What is Shell?

- Users communicate with the kernel by **shell**.
- *Shell* : is a command line interpreter.
     - It translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by kernel.
## Types of shells

Based on their features there are many shells :

1. **SH ( bourne shell )**  : simplicity was its strength and was the first shell.
2. **BASH ( bourne again shell )** : is product of the GNU project and was sought to enhance bourne shell experience.
3. **ZSH ( the Z shell )** : it is newcomer and its customizability, advanced features sets it apart.
4. **FISH**  ....etc 

They differ in Coloring, Piping, command compilation, and etc.
- To identify your shell you use this command  " *echo $SHELL* " 

# What is Operating System (OS)?

- *OS* : is the main software part of computer that helps it to work on.
- This picture clarifies OS [[Pasted image 20240413155503.png]] 

OS contains :
1. **Kernel** : It is the core that provides basic services for all other parts of the OS.
2. **Software** : a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.
3. **Desktop environment** : synonymous to GUI , how people interact to a computer.    There are different types of DE check it on the course material. 
4. **File extensions** : the suffix of a computer file that an OS uses to identify the exact file type.
5. **Window manager** : is system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface (GUI).

### Note :
- Both operating system and Kernel are types of system software. The basic difference between the two is that an operating system is a system software that acts as the interface between the users and the machine, while a kernel is a part of the operating system that converts user commands into machine language.


# Why do we use Linux?

The following are reasons why we use Linux :

1. *Fast* : no high spec computer/device needed.
2. *most used* : [[Pasted image 20240413161744.png]] 
3. *most hacking tools* : most hacking tools are built in.
4. *most secure* : offers greater degree of security than many OS.
5. *puts software updates in the hand of user* : can update when you want to.

## Linux Distributions/distro

- **Distro** : is modified Linux kernel and modified OS with different :
                                         * Linux Kernel
                                         * packages (GNU)
                                         * package manager
                                         * desktop UI
- There are so many distros : [[Pasted image 20240413163055.png]] 
     * *Debian* 
         * Kali Linux
         * Ubuntu
         * Parrot
     - *Arch* 
         - Black Arch
         - Garuda
     - *Fedora*
     - *Red Hat* 
     - *Gentoo*
     - *Android* 

## Which is best for Hackers?

- Kali Linux
- Parrot OS
- Garuda
- Black Arch   .... etc

### Kali Linux

- Is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing.

                                * shell : *zsh* 

### Parrot OS

- is Linux distribution based in Debian with a focus on :
                                             * Security
                                             * Privacy

                                 * shell : *fish*


## Do windows have distros?

- Windows is not open-source therefore people can't edit it which is why it doesn't have distro.
- Occasionally it just gives you updates and adds new features on you version.
