## What is Recon ?

- It is also called *Information Gathering* or *Foot printing*.
- *Reconnaissance* : is gathering information about an opponent's network infrastructure, including its vulnerabilities, to exploit them later on.
- Foot printing  =>  Footsteps  +  printing ( logging )
- Most people find reconnaissance boring, but it covers almost *85%* of hacking.

## Why do we need recon ?

- To get access of a system we first have to know the system or understand it.
- Knowing the system will lead you to know if the system is vulnerable.

## Types of information gathering

- Based on how we do recon there are :

### 1. Active Footprinting
- *Active Footprinting* is the process of using tools and techniques, such as performing a ping sweep or using the traceroute command, to gather information on a target. 
- Active Footprinting can trigger a target's Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and may be logged, and thus requires a level of stealth to successfully do.
- It is gathering information directly by contacting that person.
- Doing active recon without permission is **ILLEGAL!!** 

### 2. Passive Footprinting
- *Passive Footprinting* is the process of gathering information on a target by innocuous, or, passive, means. 
- Browsing the target's website, visiting social media profiles of employees, searching for the website on WHOIS, and performing a Google search of the target are all ways of passive Footprinting.
- This is when you gather information from another person, 3rd party or by checking public sources.


## What type of information do you gather ?

- We gather info for different things
#### a. host
- Websites
- Computers
- Smart Phones

#### b. network
- Home Network
- company network

#### c. Person / Organization
#### d. Application

## How do we gather info ?

- There are different techniques and methods we use :

### 1. For websites
- The info we gather about a website are :
     - IP addresses
     - Development frameworks
         - Technologies used and the versions
     - Name
     - DNS info
     - Subdomains, Assets, Contents

#### To get Ip
- To get Ip address of some website :
     - Active recon
         - Ping (website link)
         - nslookup (website link)
         - host (website link)
     - Passive recon
         - www.nslookup.io      
##### Note :
- when writing the website link don't add the https just write the link Ex. *facebook.com* 

#### To get development frameworks
- Use simple browser extension
     - Wapplyzer
     - Builtwith
- Terminal tool
     - whatweb

#### To get the name
- You can see the title of the website or texts inside the page also or in the URL

#### Details about domains
- For this you can use whois terminal  or the website tool.
     - whois
     - dig 

### 2. For computers / phones
- The info we gather about computers / hosts are :
     - Ip addresses
     - OS info
     - Hostname
     - Mac address
     - Open services or ports

### 3. For Networks
- The info we gather about a Network are :
     - Ip addresses
     - Architecture
     - Class and Type of Network
     - Subnet / VHOSTs
     - Hosts on that Network
     - Strength and security of that Network

### 4. For Personal Information
- The info we gather about a person are :
     - Full Name
     - Address
         - Physical address
         - All Social media address
         - Phone address
     - What the person loves
     - Job 
     - Friends
     - Status
     - Skills ........


## OSINT - open source intelligence

- *OSINT* : is the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources (covert sources and publicly available information; PAI) to produce actionable intelligence.
- It is gathering and analyzing different information based on public resource *passively*.
- We can get lot of information for systems, users, host, ..... through passive activity.
- There are different methods : 

### 1. Getting Names by Phone number
- For this purpose we can use  
     - https://www.truecaller.com
- We can get the phone number from social media like telegram, or posted from website.

### 2. Getting social media addresses
- If you have full name of a person, just use search engines like :
     - google
     - bing
     - yahoo
- We can also use a tool called *sherlock* from GitHub. 
     - python3 sherlock.py natanhailu

### 3. Getting physical address
- People share there living place on there social media page.
- Else there are other method :
     - sending links and when people access the link you can get the IP then you can just *geolocate* the place.

### 4. IP geolocation
- If you get the private Ip address of someone you can insert it to 
     -  https://www.iplocation.net 
- The method of getting the IP might be tricky but we will get there.

### 5. Knowing people's behavior and Obsession
- Nowadays people are being open on social media and we as security testers can access info about a person from social media like :
     - From Instagram
     - From telegram

### 6. Applications / Software
- The info we gather about an Application are :
     - What they are made up of 
         - which programming language is used
         - which framework is used
     - Source codes
     - Their logic and Function

## Reverse Image search

- *Reverse image search* : is a technique of searching with images.
- Searching using images can give us more information.
- We can use the following websites :
     - https://tineye.com/
     - https://www.labnol.org/reverse/
     - https://images.google.com/

## Google Dorking ( Google hacking )

- *Google dorks*, or *Google hacks*, are specific search queries that you type in the Google search. In return, Google presents you with targeted search results.
- It is using different **Google operators** to effectively optimize search results.
- It also involves using Google to *identify vulnerabilities* in websites.
- This is the most powerful skill of a hacker.

### Basic Operators
1. To search for something common or include related things use *+* sign
     - Ex.   *Nathan Hailu + geeztech + CEO*    
     - Don't add space between the sign and the word.
2. If we want to exclude a term we use *-* sign 
     - Ex.  *Antivirus - software* 
3. To search for an exact term we use *"* sign 
     - Ex.  *"how to eat food"* 
4. We use *wildcard* ( * ) as a placeholder for any unknown term and then find best match
     - Ex.  Estonia parliament voted on the * bill 
5. We use the Boolean *or* ( | ) 

### Advanced Operators
- These are Syntax used by Google :
#### Intitle
- Google return results with the word / phrase found within the title of the page.
     - *intitle : index.of* 
     - *intitle : "hackers bible"* 
#### inurl
- Finds a specific term within the URL
     - *inurl : view / index.shtml*
#### filetype
- Searches for a specific filetype
     - "hacking" *filetype : pdf* 
#### Intext
- Google returns links that contains Texts from that link
     - *intext* : "Hackers in Ethiopia" 

- We can mix operators, see the picture given [[Pasted image 20240515192255.png]]
- To know more about google dorking check this websites :
     1. https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/google-dorking-hacking/
     2. https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Google-dork-query

## Hackers Power

- Hackers do anything with these operators 
- As a security tester, we can also use them to optimize our search and also to create a scripts to do that.
- There is google hacking database (*GHD*) which we can access using the link :
     - https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database

##### Warning
- If you do a lot of dorking with same Ip address, Google will block you for some hours. This is because Google wants to get rid of *Bots / Scripts*.
