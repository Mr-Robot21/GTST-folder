## What is Wireless Network

- A *wireless network* refers to a computer network that makes use of *Radio Frequency*(RF) connections between nodes in the network.
- Installation cost of wireless network is cheaper than wired networks.
- *Wireless Router* is the most important device in a wireless network that connects the users with the internet.

## What is Wireless Hacking?

- A *“WiFi hack”* is any technique used to gain unauthorized access to a WiFi network.
- Usually when someone hacks into WiFi, they are able to observe all the data that is being sent via the network with *MiTM attack*.
- In wireless network we have a *wireless access point*.
- A *wireless access point* (WAP) is a networking device that allows wireless-capable devices to connect to a wired network. 
     - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/small-business/resource-center/networking/what-is-access-point.html
- A hacker can sniff the network packets without having to be in the same building where the network is located as wireless networks communicate through radio frequency.
- Most attackers use network sniffing to find the *SSID* and hack the wireless network.
- There are two modes :
     1. *Monitor mode* : your card can listen to every packets that's around it.
     2. *Managed mode* : default mode,  meaning our wireless device will only capture packets that have our device's MAC address as the destination MAC.

- To do WiFi hacking we need a *WiFi Antenna for our Computer*.
- Most Laptops have a wireless card inside of them but the desktops don't have.
- But the adapters must have a feature called *Packet Injection + monitor mode*.
- If you are on *Virtual machine* you need adapters.
- If you are on *Dual boot*, *main boot*, *live boot* you don't need adapters.

### Wireless Network Algorithms
#### Terms
- *SSID* : stands for “**service set identifier**” and is your Wi-Fi network name.
- *BSSID* : stands for **Basic Service Set Identifier**, and it's the MAC address of the access point or wireless router that is used to connect to the WiFi.
- *WLAN* : (wireless local-area network) is a group of collocated computers or other devices that form a network based on radio transmissions rather than wired connections. A Wi-Fi network is a type of WLAN.
- *Channel* : is a frequency range within which wireless devices can communicate. The frequencies used by Wi-Fi networks are typically split into : 
     - 14 channels in the 2.4 GHz band 
     - 34 channels in the 5 GHz band 
     - 59 channels in the 6 GHz band.
- *Wireless Network algorithms* are algorithms used on setting up your AP, that helps to secure the network.
- There are 4 kinds of WLAN Security Algorithms :
#### 1. WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy
- *WEP* encrypts traffic using *64 bit* or *128 bit* key in hexadecimal.
- This is a *Static key*, which means all traffic is encrypted using a single key.
- The key is used to connect to a wireless-security enabled network.
- Over time, hackers discovered security flaws in the WEP security standard and it was retired in *2004*. Today it is *obsolete*.
#### 2. WPA - WiFi Protected Access
- It was the replacement for WEP.
- It shared similarities with WEP but had improvements on how to handle security keys.
- *WPA* uses *temporary key integrity protocol* (TKIP) which dynamically changes the key the system uses.
- WPA included message integrity checks to determine if packets are altered or not
- The key used by WPA is *256 bit*.
- However despite the improvement it was exploited so this led to *WPA2*.
- *WPA key* is a password that we use to connect to a wireless network.
#### 3. WPA2 - WiFi Protected Access 2
- WPA2 operates on two modes :
     - *Personal mode* or *Pre-shared key* (WPA2-PSK) : which relies on *shared passcode* for access, used in homes.
     - *Enterprise mode* (WPA2-EAP) : is more to organizations or business use.
- Both modes use *CCMP* (Counter mode Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol). The CCMP is based on AES algorithm which provides *authenticity* and *Integrity* verification.
- However WPA2 still has drawbacks. Ex. It is vulnerable to *key reinstallation attack* (KRACK).
#### 4. WPA3 - WiFi Protected Access 3
- WPA3 introduced new features for both personal and enterprise use, including :
     - *Individualized data encryption* : when logging on to public network, WPA3 uses other method than shared password.
         - It uses *device provisioning protocol* (DPP) system like *QR codes*.
         - It uses *GCMP-256* encryption.
     - *Simultaneous Authentication of Equals protocol* :
         - This is used to create secure handshake.

### WLAN Recon
- For any WiFi sniffing activity our adapter has to be on 
     - sniffing mode --> *monitor mode*  ( default is *managed mode*)
- To check our adapter mode,
     - *iwconfig* 
- To change it we will use a tool called *airmon-ng*
     -  *airmon-ng  start  interface*
     - Ex.   airmon-ng  start   wlan0
- On Wireless networks, the info we gather are :
     - *SSID / ESSID*   -  name of the wifi
     - *BSSID*   -    mac address of the router
     - *Channel*    -   the channel it is using
     - *Algorithm*   -   which algorithm from the 4 we know
     - *Manufacturer of the router*  -   the first 6 hexadecimal no from BSSID.
- To get info about wifi network :
     -  *airodump  -ng   interface* 

### Hacking WLAN
- Let's see some hacking methods for wifi networks :

#### 1. WPS enabled
- *WiFi Protected Setup* (WPS) is a feature supplied with many routers.
- It is designed to make the process of connecting to a secure wireless network from a computer or other device easier.
#### How
- WPS uses some 8 digit code to connect and attackers brute-force this pin.
- There are many tools in Linux but we will use the simplest & easiest on android apps :
- Syntax :
     -  *sudo  reaver  i  wlan0  -b  mac_add  -vv*
- Detail on how to use it on :
     - https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-wpa-wifi-passwords-by-cracking-wps-pin-0132542/
     - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWfkeuu5Ak4
#### Prevention ways
- This is the most simple attacks to do.
- To prevent it, you just need to disable it from you router setting. 
- See this picture : [[Pasted image 20240610150023.png]] 

#### 2. Handshake Brute force
- Handshake in wireless network is the exchange of info between the access point and client at the time the client connects to it.
- This info contains a variety of keys since the exchange takes place in several stages.
- It is a *4-way handshake*.
- By default the network card listens only for the packets address to itself. The monitor mode enables the network card to listen to every packet in the air. Listening to all packets can help the card capture the 4-way handshake.
- Hackers will try to kick a person from a wifi this is called *deauthentication* and sniff the network, when the user try to connect back they will have the Handshake file.
- This file can be brute forced and get the right password.
- For this :
     1. Get wifi info
     2. Sniff on that wifi specific channel
     3. Deauthenticate the wifi ( on different shell )
     4. Get the handshake
     5. Crack it with aircrack.
##### 1. Get wifi info
- Use the following :
     -  *airodump-ng  wlan0* 
##### 2. Sniffing to the network
- On this step we will listen to specific channel of our Target.
- Syntax :
     -  *airodump-ng  interface   --channel  no  -w  file_name_to_save_to*   
     - Ex.  airodump-ng  wlan0  --channel  4  -w  joel         (-w = write it to a file)
##### 3.Deauthentication
- On another terminal, we will start a deauthentication attack.
- This will make our handshake capturing process quick.
- The handshake is captured when logged user try to connect to the network back, so we will forcedly kick him and listen for handshakes on our other terminal.
- Syntax :
     -  *airplay-ng  -O  byte_size  -a  mac_add   interface*         -a = attack target
     - Ex.  airplay-ng  -O 100  -a  33:22:11:44:44:44  wlan0    -O = how many time sent
##### 4. Capturing Handshake
- Now we got the handshake so we need to crack it ang get the password.
- To do this we will use a tool called *Aircrack-ng*.
##### We need a wordlist
- We will use the rockyou wordlist or we can create our own wordlist.
##### 5. Cracking
- Here we will brute force the password and try to crack it.
- The time depends on the wordlist you have.
- Syntax :
     -  *aircrack-ng  cap_file  -w  wordlist*
     - Ex.  aircrack-ng  joel.cap  -w  rockyou.txt
#### Prevention way
- Using *WPA3* is your best bet.
- Try to mitigate against de-authentication attacks.
- use an ethernet connection if possible.
- Use a strong passphrase to minimize the attacker chances of cracking your password.

#### 3. WEP attack
- The steps are same with Handshake brute force but the difference is here we will brute force the *encryption key* not the *password*.
- Also we don't capture handshake we just listen for WEP wifi for some minutes.
- Steps :
     1.  *airodump-ng  --bssid   bss_address  --channel  no  --write wep  interface*
         Ex. airodump-ng  --bssid 74:DA:SA:DB:F7:67  --channel 11  --write wep  wlan0
     2.  *aircrack-ng   file_name* 
         Ex.  aircrack-ng  wep.cap

#### 4. Evil-twin Attack
- It includes :
     1.  Deauthentication
     2.  Fake AP 
     3.  Phishing
- How it works :
     1. Attacker will clone one of the wifi he is going to attack making it open or public.
     2. Then he will initiate deauthentication on the real wifi, so the users will be forced to connect to the fake one.
     3. Then the attacker will fake prompt to input the password to access the the wifi.
     4. When the user adds the password, BOOM! Attacker will have the password.
- This is the most effective way to hack wifi.

#### How can do it 
- It has a lot of steps and it is complicated to do it manually, but there are a lot of tools to do it Automatically.
- One tool used is *Airgeddon*, which is cloned from GitHub

#### Prevention
- Avoid WiFi networks marked as "unsecure"
- Use your own hotspot
- Disable Wifi autosave
- Use a VPN
- Only browse HTTPS sites

## Bluetooth Hacking

- *Bluetooth* is a universal protocol for low power, near field communication operating at *2.4 - 2.485* GHz using spread spectrum.
- The minimum specification for Bluetooth range is 10m.
- Any discoverable Bluetooth device transmits the following information :
     -  *Name* 
     -  *Class* 
     -  *List of services* 
     -  *Technical information*

     2. https://intellipaat.com/blog/bluetooth-hacking/
###  How we it 
- To do a Bluetooth pen-test you need a Bluetooth adapter but our computer have it inside, and we can connect it to our virtual machine.
- To do so do the following :
     1. First install the following
         -  *sudo apt install  bluetooth  bluez  bluez-tools  rfkill  blueman* 
     2. Then we list our bluetooth
         -  *sudo rfkill  list*
     3. Then we will unblock our bluetooth devices
         -  *sudo  rfkill  unblock  bluetooth*
     4. Now we will start the bluetooth services
         - to start the service
             -  *sudo  service bluetooth start*
         - to get info about bluetooth devices
             -   *hciconfig*
         - to scan the nearby bluetooth devices 
             -  *hcitool  scan*

### Bluetooth Attacks
#### 1. BlueJacking 
- is sending messages over bluetooth.
#### 2. BlueSmaching
- is denial-of-service for bluetooth
#### 3. Bluebugging 
- Attacker is able to take control of the target's phone.
- *Bloover*  was developed as POC tool for this purpose.

## SS7 Attack

- *SS7 attacks* are mobile cyber attacks that exploit security vulnerabilities in the SS7 protocol to compromise and intercept voice and SMS communications on a cellular network. Similar to a Man In the Middle attack, SS7 attacks target mobile phone communications rather than wifi transmissions.
