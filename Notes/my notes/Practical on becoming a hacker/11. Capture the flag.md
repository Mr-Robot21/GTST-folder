## What is Capture the flag ( CTF )

- *CTF* : is a popular competition and training exercise that attempts to thoroughly evaluate participants' skills and knowledge in various subdomains. 
- The goal of each CTF challenge is to find a hidden file or piece of information (the “flag”) somewhere in the target environment.
- Flag is a text, code, asked string or number.

## CTF Types

- There are 3 types of CTF :
### 1. Attack and Defense 
- In this event, teams *defend a host* while still trying to attack opposing teams' target machines.
- Here every team has own network(or only one host) with vulnerable services. Your team has time for patching your services and developing exploits usually. So, then organizers connects participants of competition and the wargame starts! You should protect own services for *defense points* and hack opponents for *attack points*.
- The team with most points win.
### 2. Jeopardy CTF
- Jeopardy style CTF present competitors with set of question that reveal clues (hints) that guide them in solving complex tasks in a specific order.
- Teams receive point for each solved task.
- The more difficult the task the more points you can earn upon completion.
### 3. King of the Hill
- It is played in a team, the first who hack the system and patched it will be the winner.
- Here the player will act like red team and blue team. And will hack it and also patch it to prevent other competitors(hacker) from getting into the system.

## CTF Categories 

- On CTF there are different categories :
### 1. Web
- focus on finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web application.
### 2. Forensic
- participants need to investigate some sort of data like analyze .pcap files.
### 3. Cryptography
- focus on encrypting and decrypting strings from various types of cryptography.
### 4. Reversing
- it involves reverse engineering binary code.
### 5. OSINT
- often involve sniffing packets, exploiting network protocols, etc. using publicly available resources
### 6. Secure code
- here you are given a code then you find the weak spot or the error and fixing it and you find the flag.
### 7. Web3
- focus on latest technology *blockchain* and you find bug on smart contracts and so on.
### 8. Boot2root/machine/pwn
- here you are give Ip address and you find any bug and hacking the machine.

## Reverse Engineering

- *Reverse engineering* is the process of analyzing and understanding the design, structure, and functionality of a product or system by working backward from its final form. It involves taking apart an object or software to uncover its inner workings and understand how it was created.
- Software or application are cracked by reverse engineering.
- There are many tools used to reverse any software and get the assembly code for further reviews.
     - Ex.   *IDA*,  *Ghidra*,  etc.
- White hat hackers use this skill to reverse any malware and to analyze it.

4. Do more practice on CTF

## Why do we play CTF

- CTF gives us an environment to practice what we learn through theory.
- It will help us develop a hacker mindset.
- CTF will make you ready for the real world hack.
     - Develop you hacking skill & ability
     - Teach you to be patient because sometime they are challenging
- Nowadays, CTF problems are asked in job interviews to test the skill of the professional.
- You will learn how to handle pressure.

## Point Scoring

- There are two types of scoring :
     1. *Static points* :  it has a limited CTF point
     2. *Dynamic points* : has an increasing point. The one who get the flag 1st will have the highest point.
- A user who get the flag for the 1st time is called *First Blood*.
