## What is cryptography

- The word crypto is derived from two words 
     -  *Crypto*  =>  Hidden or Secret
     - *Graphy*  =>  Writing
- *Cryptography* : refers to secure information and communication techniques derived from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms, to transform messages in ways that are hard to decipher.
- It is used to secure data or text.
- It has two main components :
     1. *Encryption* 
         - is used to protect data from being stolen, changed, or compromised and works by scrambling data into a secret code that can only be unlocked with a unique digital key.
         - or is the practice of hiding messages so that it can't be read by anyone other than the intended person.
    2. *Authentication & Integrity* 
         - Ensuring that users of the data / resources is the person who is authorized and he is who he claims to be and the message it not modified / altered.

### Encryption
- To understand encryption see the pic  [[Pasted image 20240523151318.png]]
#### Cipher
- a method used in cryptography for performing encryption or decryption.
- Encryption algorithms are standardized & published.
- The *key* which is an input to the algorithm is *secret*.
     - *Key* : is a string of numbers or characters
- If *same key* is used for encryption & decryption the algorithm is called *Symmetric*.
- If *different keys* are used for encryption & decryption the algorithm is called *Asymmetric*.

### 1. Symmetric Algorithms
- are algorithms in which the key for encryption & decryption is the same.
     - Ex.  *Caesar Cipher* 
- Types :
     1. *Block Ciphers* 
         - works on a fixed-length segment of plaintext data, typically a 64- or 128-bit block as input, and outputs a fixed length ciphertext
         - The message is broken into blocks, and each block is encrypted through a substitution process.
     2. *Stream Cipher*
         - encryption technique that works byte by byte to transform plain text into code that's unreadable to anyone without the proper key.
         - Encrypt *one bit* or *one byte* at time.
#### 1. Substitution Cipher
##### 1. Caesar Cipher ( key = 3 )
- is a substitution cipher that shifts / rotates letters in a message by *three letters*.
- See the pictures to better understand 
     1. [[Pasted image 20240523154734.png]] 
     2. [[Pasted image 20240523154900.png]]
##### 2. Using a key to shift alphabet
- Here we obtain a key for the algorithm and then shift the alphabet using the key.
     - Ex. If the key is *word*, we will shift all the letters by four and remove the letters w, o, r & d from the encryption and put then first.
- We have to ensure that the mapping is *one-to-one*. 
- See the pictures below for better understanding
     1. [[Pasted image 20240523155539.png]]
     2. [[Pasted image 20240523155618.png]] 
Note :
- Replacing the letters by 1 shift we can get different rotations and we can use this website   www.rot13.com 

#### Limitations of Substitution Cipher
1. Any exposure to the secret key compromises confidentiality of the cipher text.
2. A key needs to be delivered to the recipient for message to be deciphered and some intruders can get the key leading for our message being compromised.
#### 2. AES algorithm
- The *Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)* is an algorithm that uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt protected data. Instead of a single round of encryption, data is put through several rounds of substitution, transposition, and mixing to make it harder to compromise.
- The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher chosen by the U.S. government to protect classified information.

### 2. Asymmetric Encryption
- Uses a pair of keys for encryption
     - *Public key*  for  encryption
     - *Private key*  for  decryption
- Messages encoded using public key can only be decoded by the private key.
     - Secret transmission of key for decryption is not required.
         - If I need to send you a message I just ask you for your public key and I will encrypt the message with you public key and when you receive the cipher text you can decrypt it with your private key.
         - We can put our public key out there as long as our private key is not known by anyone apart from us.
- See the pic given  [[Pasted image 20240523162831.png]] 
#### Types of asymmetric encryption
- Two most popular algorithms are *RSA* and *El Gamal*. 
#### 1. RSA
- Developed by *Ron Rivest*, *Adi Shamir*, *Len Adelman* 
- Both public and private key are interchangeable.
- Variable key size ( 512, 1024, or 2048 bits )
- Most popular public key algorithm.
- Reference websites
     1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/
     2. https://www.encryptionconsulting.com/education-center/what-is-rsa/
#### 2. El Gamal
- Developed by *Taher El Gamal*.
- Variable key size ( 512 or 1024 bits )
- Less common than RSA 
- Reference websites 
     1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/elgamal-encryption-algorithm/
     2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption 
#### Application of asymmetric encryption
- One program that uses asymmetric encryption is *SSH*. 
     - When you create / config SSH on your computer it gives 2 keys, 
         - 1st key is *public key*
         - 2nd key is *private key* 
     - So when connection is established each host exchange their public key and store it in *(known_host)*, then anytime they send data they will encrypt them with the public key and the host will decrypt them with his private key.

##### Note
- *DSA* : stands for Digital Signature Algorithm. It is a cryptographic algorithm used to generate digital signatures, authenticate the sender of a digital message, and prevent message tampering.
- Reference website :  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digital-signature-algorithm-dsa/

### Main Terms of Cryptography

#### 1. Encoding / decoding
- *Encoding* : reversible transformation of data format, used to preserve the usability of data.
- This is a method of creating cipher text with out using any text
- This can be done by doing mathematical computation on a given input.
     Ex.  *base64*, *base32*, etc.
#### 2. Encryption / decryption
- - **Encryption:** Secure encoding of data used to protect the confidentiality of data.
- This is a method of creating cipher text using a key.
- To decrypt the message you need to know the key or have a private key
     Ex. *DES*, *AES*, *RSA* 
#### 3. Hashing
- **Hashing:** A one-way summary of data that cannot be reversed and is used to validate the integrity of data
- This is a method of creating cipher text with respect to created hash.
- To reverse a hash, you search for a match but you can't decrypt / decode it.
- *Salt* : is a random string used for data modification for password protection. This can be by adding some text as prefix / suffix
     Ex.  *MD5*, *Sha254* 
- Reference website  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-hashing/

##### Note
- Encrypting or encoding are *two way* because there is decrypting & decoding.
- But hashing is *one way* because they can't be reversed but they are *cracked* or *matched*.

         - https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
    - *Tunnelsup*   - is a website
         - This helps us to analyze what the hash is based on and the bit length but doesn't decrypt the hash.
         - www.tunnelsup.com/hash-analyzer/
         - https://www.onlinehashcrack.com/hash-identification.php
#### Decoding / decrypting
- There are so many ways to reverse some hashes/ciphers.
     1. *Hashes*
         - www.Crackstation.net  ( non-salted )
         - https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash
         - Cracking by your self using google ( google the name or the hash )
             - By searching the hash type you can get the decoder / decrypter
             - You can search the hash itself
             - ##### Note :   Cracking using google is preferred for hashes. 
     2. *Encoding* 
         - Cyberchef  -   used for decoding only
     3. *Identifying unknown hashed* 
         - When encounter unnormal or unknown hashes :
             - First identify the *software* with which the hash is generated
             - Then try to search some cracking scripts made for the hash
- We can also use *wordlists* to reverse our ciphers / hashes.
     1. *Wordlists* 
         - are normal text files that contain different words that can be used to match hashes, or for checking some parameters repeatedly using loops.
         - On *Kali Linux* we have different wordlists on */usr/share/Metasploit-framework/data/wordlists* 
     2. *Custom Wordlists* 
         - We can create our own wordlists and add our highly usable words.
         - or we can use tools like :
             -  *cewl*   -  https://www.kali.org/tools/cewl/
             - *cupp*  -  is a python script

## Obfuscation

- *Obfuscation* : refers to the process of concealing something important, valuable, or critical. Cybercriminals use obfuscation to conceal information such as files to be downloaded, sites to be visited, etc.
- In software development, *obfuscation* is the act of creating source or machine code that is difficult for humans or computers to understand.
