## Anonymity 

- *Anonymity* and *identity shielding* allow a user to hide or disguise their identifying information online. While this protects their privacy, it can make it difficult to hold them responsible for what they say and do online.
- Keeping your identity private, but not your actions.
     - Ex. using fake name to post messages to a social media platform
- Anonymity is simply using a fake profile/location/identity/personality.

## Online Privacy

- What do you think about incognito / privacy tabs?
- In *Incognito* mode none of your browsing history, cookies and site data, or information entered in forms are saved on your device. This means your activity doesn't show up in your Chrome browser history, so people who also use your device won't see your activity.
- But still the sites we when using incognito mode will have our *Ip address* and other information and also *ISP* will also know.
- Therefore, they don't give as real privacy.

## Methods of Anonymity

- There are several ways to be protected or to be Anonymous on the Internet.
- These methods can change our *identity*, *location*, or *personality*.

### 1. Proxy chains
### What is proxy server 
- A *proxy server* is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network. 
- It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.

     3. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-proxy-server/
### Proxy chains
- Proxy chaining involves routing internet traffic through multiple proxy servers in a series, creating a chain-like structure. 
- This technique adds an extra layer of protection by obfuscating the original source of the connection and making it harder for adversaries to trace or intercept the traffic.
- This will hide our *IP address*.

### Types of Proxy chains
- Based on the path we follow there are 4 types of proxy chains.

#### 1. Dynamic Chain
- Dynamic Chaining uses every proxy in the proxy list. 
- If one of the proxies is down or not responding, the dead proxies are skipped, it will automatically go to the next proxy in the list without throwing an error or exception.
- If none of them doesn't work it will be broken and display error

#### 2. Strict Chain
- In strict chaining, the proxies which are present in the proxy list will be used and they will be executed in order.
- All proxies have to be up and working, if one server is not working it will display error.

#### 3. Round Robin chain
- It follows the order of the proxy list
- If one proxy is down it will skip it and go to the next.
- If all the proxies are not working it will start again and check them.
     - This makes it different from *Dynamic chain*.

#### 4. Random Chain
- As the name itself says, the proxies in the proxy list are chosen at random.
- Not working proxy will be skipped.

#### How to set up proxy chain
1. first search for *proxy servers free list* on google
     - Ex.  https://geonode.com/free-proxy-list
2. Then open your terminal and open the file */etc/proxychains4.conf4*
     - Ex.  *mousepad  /etc/proxychains4.conf4* 
3. Then edit the file by adding your proxies at the bottom of the file.
4. Now access using proxy chains :
     - Ex.  *proxychains nmap google.com*

### 2. T.O.R Network ( *T*he *O*nion *R*outing network)
- *TOR* is a free overlay network for enabling anonymous communication. Built on free and open-source software and more than seven thousand volunteer-operated relays worldwide, users can have their Internet traffic routed via a random path through the network.
- The world wide Tor computer network uses *secure*, *encrypted* protocols to ensure that users online privacy is protected.
- Tor uses an *onion-style* routing technique for transmitting data.
- When you use the *Tor browser* to communicate or access a website, the Tor network doesn't directly connect your computer to that website. Instead the traffic is intercepted by Tor and bounces to a random number of other Tor users / computers before passing the request to its final website destination.

### 3. VPNs 
- *VPN*, which stands for **virtual private network**, establishes a digital connection between your computer and a remote server owned by a VPN provider, creating a point-to-point tunnel that encrypts your personal data, masks your IP address, and lets you sidestep website blocks and firewalls on the internet.
- There are a lot of VPNs, which are *paid for* and *free*.
- The paid are more secured and private, but still the free are Good.
- Examples of VPNs :
     - *Nord VPN*, *Proton VPN*, etc.

### Types of VPN 
#### 1. SITE to SITE VPN
- A site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) refers to a connection set up between multiple networks. This could be a corporate network where multiple offices work in conjunction with each other or a branch office network with a central office and multiple branch locations.
- Router + Router
- References :
     1. https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-site-to-site-vpn

#### 2. Remote Access VPN
- A remote access VPN connects specific computers or other devices to a private network as opposed to linking entire locations together via gateways. Also, every device using this VPN setup must have the VPN client app installed.
     - Ex. Hacking games utilizes *OpenVPN* , which makes a TUN adapter letting us access the labs
- When analyzing these VPNs, an important piece to consider is the *routing table* that is created when joining the VPN.
- If the VPN only creates routes for specific networks (10.10.10.0/24), this is called a *Split-Tunnel VPN* meaning the Internet connection is not going out of the VPN.
- This is great for Hacking Games because it provides access to the Lab without the privacy concern of monitoring your internet connection.

#### 3. SSL VPN
- A secure sockets layer VPN (SSL VPN) enables individual users to access an organization's network, client-server applications, and internal network utilities and directories without the need for specialized software.
- They are done within our web browser and is becoming increasingly common as web browsers are becoming capable of doing anything.

### 4. Mac Changer 
- Mac addresses can tell about our devices, so if we change our mac that means we change our device ID.
- To change our mac address there are two ways :
#### 1. Using mac changer - used for temporary change
- We use the kali tool *macchanger*
- Steps :  
     1. First turn off your interface
         - Ex.  *sudo  ifconfig  eth0  down*
     2. Now we change our mac 
         - Ex.  *sudo  macchanger  -m  new_mac  eth0*
     3. Then turn your interface up
         - Ex.  *sudo ifconfig  eth0 up*
#### 2. without using mac changer tool - used for permanent change
- Steps :
     1. First turn down your interface 
         - Ex. *sudo  ifconfig  eth0  down*
     2. Now change your mac address
         - Ex.  *sudo ifconfig  eth0  hw  ether  new_mac*
     3. Then turn your interface up
         - Ex.  *sudo ifconfig eth0 up*

### 5. Incognito mode
- This is a mode that browsers have.
- This will help you to have a browser with out logging your history, cookies, cache, .......

### 6. Secured OS
- This are operating systems, that have a security and privacy feature.
- *Windows* and *Mac Os* will record some of your activity also they are not good on privacy and security.
- Therefore *Linux* is always recommended when you think about privacy and Security.

### 7. Temporary mail
- While you do some pen-test you don't have to expose your email and profile for this purpose you need fake emails.
- If you don't have time to create fake emails you can use fake email providers. 
     - Ex.  https://temp-mail.org/   -  it has a browser extension too
     - you can also create fake number using the website.

## True anonymity is hard

- Explanation on the given pic : [[Pasted image 20240530210846.png]] 

## 1. Deep Web

- The term "deep web" refers to all web pages that that are unidentifiable by search engines. Deep web sites may be concealed behind passwords or other security walls, while others simply tell search engines to not “crawl” them. Without visible links, these pages are more hidden for various reasons.
- Example of deep web contents include :
     - private email accounts 
     - online banking portals
     - subscription-based websites and more.
- Essentially the deep web is part of the internet that is not easily accessible to the general public.

     3. https://www.spiceworks.com/it-security/security-general/articles/dark-web-vs-deep-web/

## 2. Dark web

- The dark web is a hidden part of the internet not indexed by regular search engines, accessed through specialized browsers like Tor. It hosts both legal and illegal activities, offering anonymity but also posing risks like scams and illicit content.
- The dark web is small portion of the deep web that is intentionally hidden and requires specific software or configurations to access.
- It is unique type of Internet world.
- The links end with *.onion*, that is because it uses *TOR* networks, so you must use special .onion reading browsers.
     Ex.  *Tor browser*
- Many kinds of websites are there : [[Pasted image 20240530212346.png]] 
- The dark web is **dangerous** because a lot of evil hackers are there so we have to be anonymous or change our identity.
- Also your *ISP* won't allow you to access it.

### Accessing Dark web
- There are specific OS that are planned and made for dark web access.
- Like :
     -  *Tail Os*    -    [[Pasted image 20240530213052.png]]
     - *Whonix  OS*
     - *Qube OS* 
- Even though we use these OS for anonymity, but still the dark websites are not easy to find.
- Also, *TOR browser* is **so slow** that it might not show you the correct results.
#### Tor Browser
- To install Tor Browser on kali use :
     -  *sudo apt install torbrowser - launcher*
- To open just type on terminal :
     -  *torbrowser - launcher*
#### Hidden Wiki
- Here are websites that are found on Tor browser :  [[Pasted image 20240530213742.png]]


## DOS and DDOS attacks

- A *denial-of-service (DoS)* attack floods a server with traffic, making a website or resource unavailable. 
- A *distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)* attack is a DoS attack that uses multiple computers or machines to flood a targeted resource.
- It is purposeful attack.
- It is highly illegal!.
- Techniques :
     -  *SYN  floods* 
         - sending lots of SYN
    -  *Service Request floods* 
         - create many connections
    -  *Application level DOS* 
         - Exploiting vulns like :
             - Buffer overflow
             - SQL injection
