## What is programming language
- It is a language which helps us to communicate with computers.
- There  are many different programming languages namely :
     1. *Assembly*
     2. *C* 
     3. *C ++*
     4. *Java*
     5. *Python* .....
- Programming languages help us to write code/program.

## What is a Program
- A program is an *algorithm* expressed in programming language.
- An algorithm is a *detailed sequence of actions* to perform or accomplish a task.
- Technically, an algorithm must reach a result after a finite number of steps.

## Evolution of I/O ( input / output )
- Early in the history of computing, programs were submitted on *punch cards with all the date* they required and executed together with other programs that used the same libraries.
- Later developments introduced *interactive processing* which allowed the user to provide date while program was running. It was question and answer format.

## Generation of computers

1. 1st generation : vacuum tubes - punch cards
2. 2nd generation : transistors - programming started here with *assembly*
3. 3rd generation : integrated circuits - *BASIC, COBOL,  Pascal, Fortran, C, C++, Perl,*
4. 4th generation : Microprocessors - *Python, SQL , MATLAB* 
5. 5th generation : Artificial Intelligence 

- First generation could only solve one problem at a time. It would take days or even weeks to set up a new Program on First Generation.

## Types of Programming Languages

- Computers understand *binary ( 0/1 )*, humans don't understand this.
- Based on the closeness of the language to humans we classify it into 3
- The more they become low to the machine they are faster.
- The more they become like human language they are slower.

### Low level programming language
- These languages are  more like machines but with lots of efforts people can understand them. Ex *Assembly*

### High level programming language
- They are more close to human languages. Ex. *Python* , *C++* , *java* , ..........

### Medium level
- Languages between Low level and High level, they combine both. Ex. *C - language* 

## How do high level languages work

1. *Compilers* : are tools which help us to *convert* the whole code to *bytecode* then computer will execute it.  Ex. *Java, C, C++*
2. *Interpreter* : can directly execute the code by reading the source code line by line
        Ex. *Python* 

## Use of Programming language

1. To develop hacking tools



## What is python Programming
- *Python* : is very easy to learn because it is simplified language.

## History of Python
- developed by *Guido van Rossum*.
- is derived from many other languages like :
            * *ABC Modula-3* 
            * *C* , *C ++* 
            *   .......
            * ........
- ......

## Uses of Python

1. to write hacking script
2. machine learning
3. .....
4. ...


## IDE & Code editors

### IDE ( integrated Development Environment )
